Welcome to the PremSQL library, a powerful tool for building self-hosted, end-to-end Text-to-SQL pipelines. PremSQL offers a modular design where each component functions independently, enabling you to create fully customized workflows. Watch a Quick Demo of our latest PremSQL Agent Server and Playground

### Core Components

All the components work independently and aim to achieve a single task. It is recommended to check out each of the components sequentially to get an overall idea and how to use them to the fullest. However it is not strictly mandatory. Since each components work independently, so you can only look into the component which satisfies your need for a quick start and come back later for more indepth look.

## Getting Started

Install PremSQL with:
```bash
pip install -U premsql
```

  alt="Playground"
/>



Here's a quick example using PremSQL's agent capabilities to chat with a sample database:

```python start_agent.py
from premsql.agents import BaseLineAgent
from premsql.generators import Text2SQLGeneratorHF
from premsql.executors import ExecutorUsingLangChain
from premsql.agents.tools import SimpleMatplotlibTool

# Add a DB URI for SQLite or MySQL or Postgres. 
dsn_or_db_path = "sqlite:///path/to/data/db.sqlite"

# We are using HuggingFace. Make sure you have enough vRAM. However we support other inference engines like:
# HuggingFace, PremAI, MLX, OpenAI. You can also make your own inference engine. Ollama support coming soon. 

agent = BaseLineAgent(
    session_name="quick_start",
    db_connection_uri=dsn_or_db_path,
    specialized_model1=Text2SQLGeneratorHF(
        model_or_name_or_path="premai-io/prem-1B-SQL",
        experiment_name="text2sql_worker",
        device="cuda:0",
        type="test"
    ),
    specialized_model2=Text2SQLGeneratorHF(
        model_or_name_or_path="meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf",
        experiment_name="analysis_worker",
        device="cuda:0",
        type="test"
    ),
    executor=ExecutorUsingLangChain(),
    plot_tool=SimpleMatplotlibTool()
)

# Query the database
response = agent("/query show me the phone numbers of direct charter-funded schools opened after 2000/1/1")

# Analyze the results
analysis = agent("/analyse what patterns do you see in the data?")

# Create a visualization
plot = agent("/plot create a bar chart showing school counts by year")
```

Or, Launch AgentServer from the same agent:

```python
# After you defined your agent (as shown above), just add these additional lines:

agent_server = AgentServer(agent=agent, port={port})
agent_server.launch()
```
Now write this command in the CLI:

```bash
python start_agent.py
```

On an another terminal, launch the server using this command:

```bash
premsql launch all
```

## Why PremSQL? The Vision 

PremSQL focuses on creating local Text-to-SQL workflows. Many times, you don't want to share data with third-party systems, but still need to build generative AI solutions for productivity and innovation. PremSQL is designed to solve this by keeping your data local.

**Use Cases:**
- Database Q&A
- RAG with database integration
- SQL autocompletion
- AI-powered, self-hosted data analysis
- Autonomous agentic pipelines with database access

### How is it different from LangChain, Llama-Index, or DSPy? 

While these libraries excel in building general AI workflows, they often come with a steep learning curve for customization. PremSQL simplifies this, providing full control over your data and a smooth integration with existing LangChain, Llama-Index, or DSPy workflows.
