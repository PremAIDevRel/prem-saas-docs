title: Autonomous Fine-tuning
---

The Autonomous Fine-tuning is a powerful feature that allows developers to fine-tune AI models on our platform without needing extensive AI expertise. With The Autonomous Fine-tuning, you can easily improve the performance and accuracy of your AI models by providing feedback based on traces and training your own custom models.

## How It Works üí™

- **Data Preparation:** Collect and prepare your training data by chatting with your model. Ensure that your data is representative of the task you want your AI model to perform.

- **Feedback From Traces:** Provide positive or negative feedback to the AI model based on your [Traces](/get-started/monitoring). The [Traces](/get-started/monitoring) section allows you to analyze the model's performance to identify areas where it needs improvement.

- **Model Training:** Initiate the training process using the provided feedback and training data.
The Autonomous Fine-tuning utilizes advanced algorithms to fine-tune the AI model based on your feedback and data.

- **Model Evaluation and Deployment:** Once the training is complete, evaluate the fine-tuned model's performance in the [Lab](/get-started/lab).
Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to ensure it meets your requirements.
If satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it uisng the [Launchpad](/get-started/launchpad).
## Getting Started

<Steps>
    <Step title="Test an AI model in the Lab">

    In order to train your AI model, you must first have a conversation with the model. Each response will be added to your [Traces](/get-started/monitoring) so you can monitor how your model is performing.
        
    </Step>
    <Step title="Provide Feedback">
        <Tip>
         In order to fine-tune your model, you are required to submit at least **50** postive feedback responses. 
         Just click the thumbs up üëç for postive feedback and thumbs down üëé for negative feedback.  
        </Tip>

<Tip>
It is suggested that you use the **Traces** sections to submit feedback. 


Alterntively, you can also provide feedback from the **Lab** shown below.

    </Step>
      <Step title="Initiate the training">
      Simply click the **_Start fine-tuning_** button to begin fine tuning.

    </Step>
      <Step title="You'll recieve confirmation emails">

      The first email will confirm that the fine-tuning process has begun.

The second email will confirm that the fine-tuning has been completed.

    </Step>
    <Step title="Try your fine-tuned model in the lab">
        Now that the fine-tuning is complete, head over to the **Lab** to test it out. You can search for your fine-tuned model the same way you would with any of the pre-trained models available. You can always change the system prompt and fine-tune again until you get your model working the way you want it to.

        <Tip>
        You can also test out your fine-tuned model indivdually in the chat section of the **Lab**

        </Tip>
    </Step>

    <Step title="Launch your fine-tuned model with the Launchpad">
        Now that the fine-tuning and testing are complete, navigate to the **Launchpad** to deploy your model so it's ready for integrating into your applications. You will still have the ability to configure the model's params, system prompts and repositories.
