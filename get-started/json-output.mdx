title: Structured Output
---

Structured output allows you to always format responses according to a specific input JSON schema. As of now, the following models support structured output under PremSDK:

1. `gpt-4o`
2. `gpt-4o-mini`

To invoke function calling, you need to define a JSON schema and pass that schema inside the `response_format` argument. Here is an example to get started with structured output using PremAI SDK.

<Note>
To understand structured output, you should have an understanding of the Prem SDK. If not, please [check that out first](/get-started/sdk.mdx).

```python python 
from premai import Prem 

# Change the project_id and api_key
project_id = 12345
client = Prem(api_key="xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx")

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
]

# Create completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    messages=messages,
    model='gpt-4o',
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",

Structured Output is still on early phases. We are going to bring more improvements in near future starting from supporting structured outputs on other LLMs and support for pydantic and Zod in our SDK.
